implement CAD tools for VLSI design

   Concerns regarding the security of manufactured ICs intended for use in sensitive applications
 have grown rapidly as a result of the use of untrusted parties throughout the IC supply chain
 network. The adversarial infestation of manufactured ICs with a Hardware Trojan (HT) is one
 of these security risks. A malicious alteration to a circuit intended to control, modify, disable, or
 observe its logic is known as a Trojan. There are more designers and design firms due to the ex
pansion and globalization of IC design and development. IC design houses unable to manufacture
 their chips internally must use external foundries because building up a fabrication facility might
 easily cost more than $20 billion, and expenses for advanced nodes could be substantially higher.
 It can be difficult to build confidence with these external foundries, and they are often not trusted.
 The difficulties in the field of secure embedded system design were underlined by writers in the
 2004 publication [1]. Some of the challenges described in [1] are: Processing Gap, Battery Gap,
 Flexibility, Tamper Resistance, Assurance Gap, and Cost, One of these security threats are the ad
versarial infestation of fabricated ICs with an HT. Conventional VLSI manufacturing tests and ver
ification methods fail to detect HTs due to the different and un-modeled nature of these malicious
 modifications.
